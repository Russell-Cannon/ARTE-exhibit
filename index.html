                <p>Don Gray's series "Nine Stones" 2011 is the majority of this exhibit. It is an, initially, odd series of nine oil paintings - split between three progressions - each depicting a 'portrait of a stone. This and the next stone encompass the first progression - the other two progressions hold three and four paintings respectively.</p>
                <p>This portrait is an oil painting that captures a large rock dramatically illuminated against a dark backdrop. The artist uses bold, directional lighting to emphasize the rock's form, creating sharp contrasts between light and shadow. The paintingâ€™s composition keeps the rock as the central focal point, while the dark background enhances its prominence. This piece focuses on the mundane details of the rock: the contours along the two planes, the subtle shifts in color across its surface. Most of the detail in this painting is filled in by the viewer. We get the general shape of each object in the foreground but not much in the way of texture. Aside from the central rock, the peripheral objects are pretty ambiguous. What is the wavy line at the bottom of the page? Just below the rock, is that a hammer or a few sticks? Behind the rock, what are those black lines? Cat-tails? Reeds?</p>

                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #2</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait - the last of the first progression - depicts a large, weathered stone situated near a body of water. The stone is prominently featured in the foreground, its surface displaying a variety of colors and textures, including shades of pink, yellow, and blue. The background includes a calm body of water with reflections and a distant shoreline. The interplay of light and shadow on the stone and the surrounding landscape creates a visually striking and serene scene, highlighting the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment. The painting's composition draws the eye to the central stone, while the surrounding elements enhance its prominence and add to the overall peaceful atmosphere.</p>
                <p>This piece is considerably clearer in about every aspect. The texture is much finer on the stone - the layers on the front-most face of the stone can even be counted. The light is much more prevalent in this piece as the sun appears to be higher in the sky. The shadows are cast at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon, showing the height of a few of the planes on the stone. The clarity in this piece makes it feel much more naturalistic - for a portrait of nature - than the previous piece. It is more believable than even the first piece, partially due, also, to the 'wider' view we get into the surrounding area.</p>

            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel three, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #3</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait captures a large, angular stone set between abstract, large-brushstroke patterns that suggest a natural environment. The stone is predominantly yellow and green, with hints of brown and dark blue shadows, giving it a textured and weathered appearance. The background features dynamic, sweeping lines in shades of green and blue, which may represent foliage or the sky, adding a sense of movement and depth to the composition. The interplay of light and shadow on the stone highlights its rough surface and irregular shape, making it a focal point of the artwork, along with its uncommon detail compared to the surroundings. This piece captures more of the essence of a natural landscape through an impressionistic style.</p>
                <p>This piece, while in another progression, feels like a combination of the first two portraits. The colors are again washed predominately by a single tone - yellow rather than blue. While we get more texture in some sections of the painting, others are even more abstract. The flora in this entire piece is very abstract, surrounding the stone. The shrubbery (?) in the bottom left is very blurred, bleeding into the lower half of the stone. To the upper left, there are dark green grass stalks with too bright yellowish highlights on them that feel alien - the eyes continue to try to decide what exactly they are. To the upper right, there are these bizarre green-yellow fronds that touch down to the shaded side of the stone, receiving shadows from the stone. Again, there is a satellite stone around the central stone that has the same detail, a pattern seen in all three portraits, so far.</p>

            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel four, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #4</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait features a large, smoother stone situated in a landscape of primarily reddish-brown hues. The stone has a mix of light and dark areas, created by an odd light - potentially a low sun, but the shadows don't quite make sense to the eye. The background steps from dark vegetation on the left side, adding texture and depth to the scene, to a far blue lake or river. The water is a strip of blue on the horizon, contrasting with the predominantly warm tones, it is surrounded by the red landscape below and above it on the canvas.</p>
                <p>The piece emphasizes the stone, again, through the use of strategic detail. Within the context of the much more chromatically interesting water in the background, it is interesting how Don Gray keeps the viewer on the stone. The brushstrokes feel more similar to the first piece, with these tight lines of varying width streaking across the canvas. There also appears to be tiny hands across the painting, especially around the shadow of the stone. There is a brushstroke towards the bottom of the piece that almost looks like a hand pulled down across a foggy mirror. To the right of the center of the stone, there is three dark ovals placed like finger prints, as well as a thumb print and a line where the palm would end, in the shadow of the stone. These hands don't look perfect but there similar enough to be almost eerie when viewing this painting.</p>

            <img class="stone" src="DGstone5.jpg">
            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel five, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #5</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait features a large, partially-rough stone in the center, depicted with earthy shades of brown, orange, and gray. The painting captures the stone's form using expressive brushstrokes that highlight its weathered appearance. The background is composed of abstract, muted tones, evoking a rocky or desert landscape with a river running through them. The choice of what to detail, such as certain edges and textures, draws attention to the stone's characteristics. </p>
                <p>This stone is the last in the second progression - held together best by the presence of the river seen in full in stone four and up-close in stone three. It has the most pronounced detail-disparity. Everything apart from the stone is in progressively less detail as they get higher on the canvas and, presumably, farther in space from the viewer. The foreground is out of focus but still discernable as a scattering of pebbles on the grass, but the background is so blurry it is almost flat. The stone is also the only thing that casts or receives shadows in the entire scene, defining the shaded section of itself better than anything in the entire composition. The unshaded sections of the stone, conversely, appear almost smooth. </p>

        <div id="slide-6"> 
            <img class="stone" src="DGstone6.jpg">
            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel six, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #6</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait presents a large, irregularly shaped stone with a predominantly yellowish hue, set on a grassy surface. The background consists of a vague, varying shades of green and brown, potentially another body of water. The lighting virtually only affects the stone, setting it with deep shadows on the right hand side and casting onto the grass. </p>
                <p>The 'water' in this piece is incredibly odd. It appears to be a smooth section of very short grass, but eventually 'clicks' and becomes water in my eyes. The way the grass at the top right is apparently mirrored across the darkest shade initially caused my eyes to see water. With the idea that this is a body of water, more starts to make sense. The shifts in value and saturation across the surface become clouds, and the smearing of the paint becomes waves. </p>

        <div id="slide-7"> 
            <img class="stone" src="DGstone7.jpg">
            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel seven, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #7</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait showcases a large, irregularly shaped stone, depicted with an array of colors, primarily shades of purple, pink, and white. These colors give the stone a bright and almost ethereal look. The background is composed of darker hues, which contrast with the lighter tones of the stone, making it stand out prominently. Visible brushstrokes add a sense of movement and depth to the painting, enhancing its dynamic quality. The choice of colors and textures transforms this ordinary stone into a captivating subject.</p>
                <p>The lighting in this piece doesn't quite make sense. The shadow cast by the stone to the right of itself is too dark, not uncommon to this series but noticeably less acceptable. Despite that shadow, the stone itself is not noticeably shaded - it feels incredibly flat. The background, similar to that of the fifth stone, is incredibly vague. But too a drastically stronger level, to the point nothing is discernable. Combined with the unnaturally vibrant pinks and purples, the entire scene feels impossible.</p>

        <div id="slide-8"> 
            <img class="stone" src="DGstone8.jpg">
            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel eight, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #8</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait features a large, irregularly shaped stone resting on a rocky surface. The stone exhibits a blend of white, gray, and brown hues, with shadows and highlights that give it a three-dimensional, lifelike appearance. The background is again an abstract representation of the surrounding environment. The artist's use of color and light accentuates the stone's form and texture, transforming it into a focal point of the painting. </p>
                <p>This piece feels like a return to realism after the previous stone, with believable tones and more shading. The background is very similar to stone five, decreasing in detail as it travels up the canvas. This piece seems to fight with perspective again, struggling to keep the background far away and the surface beneath the stone at a proper angle. Interestingly, I find myself noticing chinese-esque characters in the brushstrokes of the front-most surface of the stone. Specifically, I see a 'dÃ ' character from simplified Chinese just above the center of the stone, but other and more vague characters are discernable around it.</p>

        <div id="slide-9"> 
            <img class="stone" src="DGstone9.jpg">
            <div class="label"><p><i>Nine Stones</i> panel nine, Don Gray, 2009, Oil on board, 23 x 23".</p></div>
            <div style="position: absolute; top: 40vh; width: 90%; text-align: left; left:5%;">
                <h1 class="stroke">Stone #9</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="stone-p">
                <p>This portrait features a large stone with a rough texture and a mix of light and dark areas, suggesting variations in material and shadows. The stone rests on a ground covered with smaller rocks and dirt, while the background includes some vegetation, possibly tall grass. The use of earthy tones, such as browns, yellows, and grays, creates a natural and realistic appearance. </p>
                <p>This piece, like stones two and five, caps its progression with a relatively normal depiction of a stone. The space is believable, the tones are sensible, and detail is less conservatively applied. This rock does, however, have the densest use of pattern of the previous pieces. Specifically, the orange-brown patch of the stone near the bottom has these short, regular brushstrokes in a general gradient from muddied brown to red-brown used around the stone. The detail on this stone is significant compared the rest of the series and continues to the pebbles in the bottom left corner of the canvas.</p>
                <p>This piece captures the raw beauty of nature, transforming an ordinary stone into a subject of artistic contemplation. In essence, Don Gray's *Nine Stones* is a visual ode to the natural world's often overlooked elements, urging us to slow down and see the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

                <p>
                    The cognitive dissonance that comes from sitting in a stadium, watching the equivalent of paint dry is incredibly compelling, to me. This idea, from Max Peintner's dystopian pencil drawing, was brought to life in 2019 by Klaus Littmann with his temporary art installation by a similar name. This inversion inherently asks why it is so odd. Why can't we appreciate nature like we do sport? Littmann's installation, "FOR FOREST - The Unending Attraction of Nature," brings this concept to a larger audience, placing a mundane forest in a place of spectacle and excitement. By doing so, it changes the lens we see it in. Rather than an accepted aspect of the planet, the forest is re-mystified, asking viewers to reconsider their relationship with nature.            </div>
